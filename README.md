# Crane

Crane was my ([qw-in](https://github.com/qw-in)) submission to the [Shopify App Challenge: Commerce and COVID-19](https://www.shopify.com/partners/blog/shopify-app-challenge?itcat=partner_blog&itterm=app_challenge_winners#) in May 2020. I put it together during weekends & evenings over the course of two weeks or so.  

## Summary of the submission

Crane was an alternative to Shopify's online sales channel (before Shopify's hydrogen or oxygen existed). It would connect to a GitHub repo of the merchants choice and manage deploying their Gatsby site to Vercel (I had plans to support other frameworks and clouds).

During development, I also built [gatsby-source-shopify-incremental](https://github.com/dignified-org/gatsby-source-shopify-incremental) to support incremental data fetching and environment previews.

There is also a rudementary [example Gatsby theme](https://github.com/dignified-org/gatsby-starter-crane) I forked from the Gatsby example.

Most of the submission has been lost to time and changes in Shopify's partner dashboard, but here is what I could dig up
